This project aims to develop a predictive analysis model for loan approval, leveraging 
historical data to evaluate the loan repayment by applicants. By analysing various 
financial factors, the model seeks to enhance decision-making efficiency, and improve 
the overall accuracy of the loan approvalÂ process.
